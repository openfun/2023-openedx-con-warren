# ðŸ”¥ Potsie v2 ðŸ’¥ Learning Analytics Charts That Rock! ðŸ¤˜

## Abstract

When starting with dashboarding in open source, it's not that hard to find a suitable 
system for analytics. Available tools are fairly efficient for generalist purpose but
are restrictive for domain-driven indicators and do not integrate well with learning 
standards such as LTI. At FUN, after having integrated Grafana in our learning analytics
stack, we are moving towards an in-house definition of a dashboard suite as a collection
of integrable web components for learning applications.
